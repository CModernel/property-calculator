## 🧮 How It Works

### The Math Behind It

```
Monthly Cash Flow:
├─ Income (fortnightly × 26 / 12)
├─ Personal Expenses (weekly × 52 / 12)
├─ Property Costs (loan payment + strata + utilities + council + insurance)
├─ Rental Income (weekly × 52 / 12)
└─ = Amount to Offset

Loan Calculation with Offset:
├─ Each month: Balance - Offset = Effective Balance
├─ Interest calculated on: Effective Balance × Monthly Rate
├─ Payment: Always same amount (P&I)
├─ More offset → Less interest → More principal paid
└─ Result: Loan paid off faster
```

### Example Scenario

```
Property Price:     $500,000
Down Payment:       $250,000
Loan Amount:        $250,000
Interest Rate:      5.38%
Monthly Payment:    $1,401

With Offset Strategy:
├─ Deposit $1,200/month to offset
├─ Time to pay off: ~5.2 years
├─ Total interest:  ~$35,000
└─ Savings vs 30yr: ~$237,000 ✨
```
